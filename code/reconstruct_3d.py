    some functions are missing.

    NOTES
    (1) The code has been written so that it can be easily understood. It has
    not been written for efficiency.
    (2) Don't make changes to this main function since I will run my
    reconstruct_3d.py and not yours. I only want from you the missing
    functions and they should be able to run without crashing with my
    reconstruct_3d.py
    (3) Keep the names of the missing functions as they are defined here,
    otherwise things will crash
